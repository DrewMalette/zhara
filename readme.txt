Setup:
To Play this game you must first have the following installed:
Python 3.5 or higher
Pygame (if you experience intermittent fatal errors make sure you are running from the python consol or IDLE3 as this game uses a lot of memory [about 1GB in some parts]).

This game has been tested on pygame 2.0.0dev3 and a bunch of the older versions. I reccommend pygame2 as it runs a LOT faster.

You also need the following libraries:
pytmx
pyscroll
To install run these commands in the command prompt/terminal:
  pip3 install pygame 2.0.0dev3
	pip3 install pytmx
  pip3 install pyscroll
Game Play:
Run main.py to play (open in IDLE3 [right click "open with Idle3" press F5 to run or use another IDE, or use the python consol)
